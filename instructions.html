            You control a <highlight class="green-text">GREEN</highlight> dot on the screen. <highlight class="yellow-text">GOLD</highlight> will randomly appear somewhere on the screen every now and then. Collecting them increases your score. You NEED all of it... Be careful, though, as obstacles (indicated by <highlight class="red-text">RED</highlight>) will appear and they'll deal damage to you when they hit you. You have 3 HP. Get as much gold as you can. <highlight class="red-text underline-red">It all belongs to you and nobody else...</highlight>
        </p>
        <p>
            The game gets more difficult as time passes. There's also power-ups that'll help you (most of the time). Just be careful not to accidentally get a dupe, which will cause a random hallucination.
